            An essential step is removing the liquid from the grated cucumber to prevent the yoghurt from becoming diluted and thin, which would affect both the flavour and texture. This is best achieved as described below, where the salt helps to extract the juice. Another key point is to use thick and strained yoghurt for an authentic texture – runny Greek yoghurt is more suitable if you want to achieve a sauce.
            <ul class="sl simple">
                <li class="sli">½ a large cucumber</li>

                <li class="sli">2 cloves of garlic</li>

                <li class="sli">2 tablespoons quality extra virgin olive oil</li>

                <li class="sli">1 x 500g tub of strained Greek yoghurt</li>

                <li class="sli">1 small bunch of fresh dill</li>

                <li class="sli">a few sprigs of fresh mint</li>

                <li class="sli">1 lemon</li>

                <li class="sli">1 teaspoon dried mint</li>

            </ul>
